# Python White Board Application

This project is a **simple whiteboard drawing application** built with **Python and Tkinter**.  
It allows users to draw freely on a canvas, change colors, adjust brush size, and clear the board.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate **basic Python usage**, GUI development, and event-driven logic.

## 💡 Project Context (Important Note)

My **primary stack is MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**.

I do **not** consider Python one of my core skills; however, I have used it to build **basic functional applications** like this one. This project reflects my ability to:

- Quickly learn and apply new technologies
- Work with event-driven programming
- Build usable applications outside my main stack

I am fully open to **deepening my Python knowledge** if the role or project requires it.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is included in my portfolio to showcase:

- Programming fundamentals
- GUI logic and state handling
- Technical versatility beyond my main stack
